  <li> Hello my name is Rainul Islam Avash and I’m currently an student studying in RMIT (s3683053),
      I’m from Bengali and my favorite hobbies are fishing and online gaming. My interest in IT, it all started
      when I was playing games on my first computer at the age of 3 and through that seeing IT and many of the technologies
      has been changing and some of the experience I have on IT are the computers around us, the phones everyone’s using
      to make a call or an alarm or navigation to social medias.<br>

  <li> Hello my name is Tingyu Gong but can also call me Aaron and I’m currently an RMIT student (s3678272),
      I’m from China, a country with 5000 historical civilizations and my favorite hobbies are going for walk with my pet
      dog, movies and also gaming. Interest in IT begin when technology became advanced that information could transmit to
      different locations or places in seconds and through the knowledge taught in high school which gave me interest in studying IT.

  <li> Hello my name is Yiyang Xiang but can also call my Tony and I’m currently a student studying in RMIT (s375182),
      I’m from China and some of my favorite hobbies are playing games, watching NBA sports and I’m a big fan of GOLDEN STATE
      WARRIORS and of course movies. My interest started when I first ran my Hello World program during high school. It gave that
      satisfactory feeling when the program displayed hello world onto the desktop. Experience on IT could only say that the
      computers we use nowadays that we interact with and other coding languages if that counts.

</ul>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Group Processes : </u></h3>
<p>In Assignment 2 we all took different parts of the assignment to complete which was a good job that was accomplished because everything
	 went smooth as no one had any difficulty doing the part they took. As for assignment 3 we did the same as the previous assignment like
	 splitting the parts of the assignment to the group members and there won’t be any changes to the project idea we are doing.<br></p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Career Plans : </u></h3>
<p>Our team has 5 different ideal jobs and they are IT Security Engineer, Release Analyst, Senior/Junior Marketing Data Analyst, Cloud
	 Architect and System Engineer. As for career plans there are many ways to approach them but for now we are learning the concepts and
	 many courses in universities but then later through the years we could learn and gain experiences from jobs and from other professionals.<br>
   There are a few of these jobs that have similar elements like IT Security Engineer and System Engineer they both have Security and User-Administrator
	 but as for the other three jobs they all are concerned about the data analyzing like moving data to the cloud system or to another new system that needs
	 migration. The ideal jobs aren’t really have a difference because there's two jobs that are IT Security Engineer and System Engineer similar that works
	 on system security and system managing while two other Release Analyst and Senior/Junior Marketing Data Analyst that’s based on data analysis and data moving
	 and the last one is Cloud Architect which has a few similar work done.<br></p>

		<li>Here's a link to the GitHub Repository <a href="https://github.com/s3673324/COSC1078_Assignment3">Click Here</a></li>
		<li>Overall on the Github Repository was really impressive as everything went smooth, we get to upload everything we got onto GitHub, there was not any problem for
			 everyone to get their work uploaded.</li>
</ul>

<h2><u> Project Description </u></h2>
<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Aims : </u></h3>
<p>The goal of our team is to explore and develop through a series of technologies such as visualization, to develop a new concept of the product, so that someone who can't see
	 it notices the visual sensor and sees the face of the world in a special way. Thus, the creature's eye is reflected by the light on the object and transmitted to the brain to
	 create an image.  Simply put, visual data is just data that stimulates our visual organs, which in turn create images in our brains. The conceptual concept of our team is to
	 absorb these data by artificial methods and provide corresponding nerve stimulation to the brain in the brain, which induces the brain to think that the data is provided through
	 the eyes, creating images for the visually impaired, so that they can see the world.</p>

<p>For the realization of this concept, the task volume will be huge. Our current goal is to explore the information principle of visual feedback to the brain's nerve center.
	 Secondly, we will learn through a series of courses and explore through the cooperation of the team. A terminal or just an application that analyzes the captured image in
	 conjunction with the camera function.  The final goal of the branch is to explore any information that is translated into a stimulus and transmitted to the brain to provide an
	 outside picture for people with visual impairment. Of course, in this project, there will definitely be many problems that we have not considered at this stage. These are the things we have to face and the countless small goals that we will eventually achieve.</p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Roles : </u></h3>
<p>To begin with, I think Tony (yiyang) plays a role as an HR in our group, considering he "recruited" us into the group and separated the tasks. And apart from that he also  plays
	a role in communication, as you know the members in this group are from different countries and have different habits, including the habit in terms of the application they use to
	chat or communicate in their daily life. Most of us prefer to use Messenger,but Tingyu Gong can only use Wechat. In order to solve this problem, Tony comes up an ideal. Since he
	had both Wechat and Messenger account, he is willing to bring the message to Gong or help him send the message to other members.  Then Steven is responsible for web-designing which
	may involve lots of coding, so I would say that he is a technical designer in our group. As for the Gong his task involves lots of data and he need to analyze those data and make some
	rank. Hence, his task immediately reminds me of a data analyst whose job is to take that data and use it to help companies make better business decisions. And for the Rainul, we choose
	to use his project idea and he is willing to cover this part in Assignment 2, as he knows the best about his own idea, which made him a lead developer in this group.  Finilally, Jimmy
	considers himself as an advisor, which is reasonable because not him only finds out what we need to prepare if we want to do some tests but also he lists some potential risks that this technology may cause. </p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Scopes and Limits : </u></h3>
<p>For this project we made concepts and ideas to develop an eye to enable blinds to see the world around them so we would show this product to anyone that’s willing to change their life in seeing many things.
	 We will be using every technology invented to ensure this project to be successful through many difficulties that we will encounter.</p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Testing : </u></h3>
<ul>
	<li>R & D</li>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Wired connection :</b> connecting the artificial eye directly to the occipital lobe via conducting wires or a microchip implant.</li>
			<li><b>Wireless connection : </b>to connect neurons to an electrical impulse frequency reader which the eye becomes a portable video camera and passes the output in electrical impulses towards the reader.
					The reader sends the electrical impulses to the brain to analyse and give it meaning like a human eye.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Testing</li>
		<ul>
				<li>Testing of the prototype is conducted with animal analogs that are already blind or visually impaired of one or both eyes due to trauma or disease, or using lab-born animals which needs to be
					  approved by domestic and international ethics boards.</li>
				<li>The test consists of the process of incision of the prototype to the animal, the health and wellbeing of the animal is observed and recorded. The surgery is conducted by a neurosurgeon and
					  ophthalmologist with the assistance of nurses and veterinarians. The animal’s vision is tested by conducting a visual aid test ran by veterinarians.</li>
				<li>Testing of both wired and wireless is successful when the surgery is successful and there are no discernable problems and faults of the eye and vision post-surgery. The animal can complete the visual aid tests as well.</li>
				<li>The WHO defines human participants as any participant who undergoes social, biomedical, behavioural or epidemiological experiments and studies. They are exposed to observation of their behaviour and actions and are manipulated physically or mentally.
				<br><a href="​https://www.who.int/ethics/research/en/"> Heres a link on the Ethics Research</a></li>
				<li>Human testing is near-impossible and would be denied by any ethics & standards board domestically and internationally as the surgery is high risk and very dangerous to the participant. The surgery is also very difficult
					  and precise to perform, and require If the surgery is unsuccessful, the participant be affected with seriously injured to the brain or death.

</ul>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> TimeFrame : </u></h3>
<p>Regarding the task of our development project, the time left for us to prepare for development is actually very compact, and we have to take all our time and energy to face it.  In this regard, we have developed a task allocation schedule, in which we have
	 prepared sufficient task objectives and the corresponding allocation time for each task, and we will also complete the corresponding content according to the timetable. The task is to ensure that the final project can be completed as expected.</p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> TimeFrame : </u></h3>
<p>The process of sight begins when light enters the eye,the cornea and lens focuses light to the retina. photoreceptors in the retina then convert the focused light into electrical inpulses, which is transported to the brain.</p>
<p>In blind people, part of the process doesn't work, the cornea or lens can be damaged from trauma or disease or the retina can't perceive light. In others, the signal is lost somewhere along the visual pathway in the brain.
<br><a href="https://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/bionic-eyes.htm">Here's a link to the Conditions about the Bionic Eye</a></p>
<p>When developing an eye that is wirelessly connected to a person’s neurons, there are 4 main risks that can be concerning:</p>
	<ol>
			<li>Risk of developing new technology, there isn’t much reference of an artificial eye that possess the characteristics of an eye nor processes for the surgery.</li>
				<ul>
						<li>There are physical lens implants that can be used as a reference for our design, but only if the research information was given with consent by the manufacturer.</li>
						<li>There are no known studies that is similar to what we aim to develop, which means time, R&D and money increases.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Developing a wired/wireless eye that connects to the brain/neurons can be halted due to international ethics from a scientific and medical standpoint.</li>
				<ul>
						<li>The construct of how to perform the surgery is life-threatening.</li>
						<li>Cannot be tested with human participants, unless experimental surgery is conducted with consent.</li>
						<li>It is also highly invasive.</li>
						<li>Finding human analogs for experimentation can be difficult from animal testing.</li>
						<li>It is near-impossible for the surgery to be done by man due to the complexity and extremely high risk.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Technology and processes to work on neurons is not present today.</li>
				<ul>
						<li>The process of connecting specific neurons for eyesight or finding particular neurons does not exist yet.</li>
						<li>Medical machinery and technology have not reached the optimal precision to perform the surgery.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Glass technology has not reached the same high-fidelity output as the human eye.</li>
				<ul>
						<li>The clarity and opacancy of the glass for cameras in the present are not the same quality as a human eye.</li>
						<li>The strength and mohs scale of the glass need to be very high, if there were to be any imperfections or scratches, it can cause visual artifacts for the user.</li>
						<li>Having sight that’s slightly affected can deter people to consent to the life-threatening surgery.</li>
				</ul>
	</ol>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Group processes and communications : </u></h3>
<p>We Communicate through Wechat and Facebook messenger as everyone mostly is active on it and easier to communicate to each other, usually everyone replies back in a
	 few hours so not really a problem but even if it was we could always email them, we do meet once a week most of the times but sometimes twice a week if we get stuck on a part
	 that everyone needs to participate on apart from meeting during tutorial and lectures.</p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Skills And Jobs </u></h3>
<p>The main purpose of our project is to rebuild  visual ability for the blind, to do so we want to build a device that can replace human eyes to collect visual data  and provide the same stimulation to the brain
   which can induce the brain to think that the data is provided through the eye, so it will create images for the visually impaired. Needless to say that this technology involves many technical fields related to brain  nerves, and none of our
	 team members have those skills. Therefore, we urgently need neurologists and use their professional skills to help us know better about how the visual system works, which nerves play which part, ect. So hiring a neurologist is our highest
	 priority in order to finish the job. As for the experience, we hope that our candidate have done additional training in optic nerve which is a paired cranial nerve that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.
   Besides the neurologist, we have decided that we also need to hire a 3D modeler who can  create three-dimensional models or visuals of our prototype using a variety of different computer software programs and tools, considering we may
	 experiencing tons of failures our prototype may frequently change from time to time so we hope our 3D modeler can take this job as his full time job. Additional we need to hire a Mechanical Engineer to design the prototype and finally a
	 programmer is the last position that we need to hire and his job is to write the code that translate the actually visual data to the information that our brain can process.</p>
