  <li> Hello my name is Rainul Islam Avash and I’m currently an student studying in RMIT (s3683053),
      I’m from Bengali and my favorite hobbies are fishing and online gaming. My interest in IT, it all started
      when I was playing games on my first computer at the age of 3 and through that seeing IT and many of the technologies
      has been changing and some of the experience I have on IT are the computers around us, the phones everyone’s using
      to make a call or an alarm or navigation to social medias.<br>

  <li> Hello my name is Yiyang Xiang but can also call my Tony and I’m currently a student studying in RMIT (s375182),
      I’m from China and some of my favorite hobbies are playing games, watching NBA sports and I’m a big fan of GOLDEN STATE
      WARRIORS and of course movies. My interest started when I first ran my Hello World program during high school. It gave that
      satisfactory feeling when the program displayed hello world onto the desktop. Experience on IT could only say that the
      computers we use nowadays that we interact with and other coding languages if that counts.

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Group Processes : </u></h3>
<p>In Assignment 2 we all took different parts of the assignment to complete which was a good job that was accomplished because everything
	 went smooth as no one had any difficulty doing the part they took. As for assignment 3 we did the same as the previous assignment like
	 splitting the parts of the assignment to the group members and there won’t be any changes to the project idea we are doing.<br></p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Career Plans : </u></h3>
<p>Our team has 5 different ideal jobs and they are IT Security Engineer, Release Analyst, Senior/Junior Marketing Data Analyst, Cloud
	 Architect and System Engineer. As for career plans there are many ways to approach them but for now we are learning the concepts and
	 many courses in universities but then later through the years we could learn and gain experiences from jobs and from other professionals.<br>
   There are a few of these jobs that have similar elements like IT Security Engineer and System Engineer they both have Security and User-Administrator
	 but as for the other three jobs they all are concerned about the data analyzing like moving data to the cloud system or to another new system that needs
	 migration. The ideal jobs aren’t really have a difference because there's two jobs that are IT Security Engineer and System Engineer similar that works
	 on system security and system managing while two other Release Analyst and Senior/Junior Marketing Data Analyst that’s based on data analysis and data moving
	 and the last one is Cloud Architect which has a few similar work done.<br></p>

<h2><u> Project Description </u></h2>
<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Aims : </u></h3>
<p>The goal of our team is to explore and develop through a series of technologies such as visualization, to develop a new concept of the product, so that someone who can't see
	 it notices the visual sensor and sees the face of the world in a special way. Thus, the creature's eye is reflected by the light on the object and transmitted to the brain to
	 create an image.  Simply put, visual data is just data that stimulates our visual organs, which in turn create images in our brains. The conceptual concept of our team is to
	 absorb these data by artificial methods and provide corresponding nerve stimulation to the brain in the brain, which induces the brain to think that the data is provided through
	 the eyes, creating images for the visually impaired, so that they can see the world.</p>

<p>For the realization of this concept, the task volume will be huge. Our current goal is to explore the information principle of visual feedback to the brain's nerve center.
	 Secondly, we will learn through a series of courses and explore through the cooperation of the team. A terminal or just an application that analyzes the captured image in
	 conjunction with the camera function.  The final goal of the branch is to explore any information that is translated into a stimulus and transmitted to the brain to provide an
	 outside picture for people with visual impairment. Of course, in this project, there will definitely be many problems that we have not considered at this stage. These are the things we have to face and the countless small goals that we will eventually achieve.</p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Plans And Progress : </u></h3>
<p>The goal of our project is to develop a visionary aid that will help our patients to see regardless of them having eyes or not. In the past many have tried to do the same, but not with the condition
	 where our patients not only lack eyesight but also eyes as well. This has proven to be mostly difficult as we had to take into consideration different aspects of our brain, how signals are sent and received and many more. One of the most difficult
	 challenges so far we have faced is for us to come up with a prototype that can take pictures just like our eye, converting them into data and then sending it back as a form of stimuli into our brain. The reason being is our lack of precision which
	 dictates our capability of sending in data without causing any side effects as well as the measures we have to go through to ensure no damage is done to the neuron cells while processing that data and conveying it to the optical lobe in order to create desired images.</p>
	 <img src="image/ML1.jpg" align="right" style = "height:300px;width:500px;">
<p>On the lighter side, we have come up with plausible solutions as to how to control such a device once it is invented. We have studied <b>Action potential</b> i.e. <b>Spikes</b> in our brain and how it transmits signals as a form of binary with the difference of being only 15 millivolts. We have looked into <b>Field potential</b> which may help us control our device. We have also studied the <b>BCI</b> (Brain Computer Interface) and the different non-intrusive methods such as <b>EEG</b> and <b>fMRI</b>. These are our ways to detect brain signals of our motor cortex which we can use to control the artificial eye. The BCI is still at a stage where it cannot read the mind accurately which also came as one of our hurdles while developing our project. Our solution to such an issue is to introduce an <b>ML</b> (Machine Learning) which is capable of remarking the distinction between signals specially the spikes. This ML will learn on its own according to our user making it flexible and adjustable to different users. For reading the field potential, we would be using an <b>AI</b> (Artificial Intelligence) which works opposite to ML. ML focuses more on the accuracy rather than the success rate, AI on the other hand aims to increase the chance of success rather than the accuracy. These two distinct forms of programming will achieve different tasks. The ML will read the Action Potential with accuracy and then will send that data to the AI. The AI will then read the data sent by the ML along with the readings it has done itself on the Field Potential, incorporate those two sets of data ensuring success to produce a much more accurate data and send it to our device as control signals.</p>
<p>One of the other issues we have come across is the designing of a three-dimensional eye. Doing so may mean we have to incorporate our device to the brain permanently which we are desperately trying to avoid. It would be more appealing if it acted more like a pair of glasses which one could take off before heading to bed.</p>
<p>One solution that comes to mind is that we can try focusing the light more so to avoid an exact replica of an eye, instead the light would become more condensed and focused. This may help us in avoiding the full depth and proportion of an actual eye rather it would be something resembling a pair of glasses. The chip at the back of the lens would process the image. For this it would be using a <b>CNN</b> (Convolutional Neural Network), a type of AI neural network which is based upon the visual cortex. It can learn the necessary features on its own and can readjust the weight parameters of each filter in order to minimize classification errors. These can vary from change of colour distinction to enhancing signals received from the brain.
</p>
<p>Another approach to this which seems more likely but comes with more limitations is a compound eye, which can be crafted with smaller but finer lenses, shaped into a grid like structure fitted on the glasses. The point being of such structure is we can activate parts of it, the size of our iris, and reactivate other parts based on the movement of our iris. In this form, all the lenses will either be in a resting or stimulated state, means only parts of it will be taking in light at a time. This will give a more grid like view for our user but in return we can avoid moving the iris with a 3D modeled structure. This will also remove our previous problem of the glass being just one lens taking in all the image at once which can disorient our user. Not to mention it could have been physically impossible to find a lens with a focal length that could fit our criteria. Further development on this grid-lens structure could minimize the grid view for our user.</p>
<p>However, this does not fix our issue of intrusion. The way that we send the image back still falls within the risks to our users. Our process involves us getting directly in contact with the nerve endings which may get damaged due to technical issues and limitations not only on the hardware perspective but also on the software perspective as well. The best solution for now would be to go for alternate locations which is near enough to stimulate the nerves but also not under direct contact. For this we need to study the nervous system in depth to come up with a suitable location.</p>
<img src="image/AI.jpg" align="right" style = "height:300px;width:500px;">
<p>The way of sending this data could be something resembling the <b>tDCS</b> (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation), as it was seen to improve one’s short term memory through passing of weak electrical current between two sponge-covered electrodes placed on the head.</p>
<p>We have formed two parts of one whole loop, starting from the <b>Signal reader</b> which reads the brain waves from the motor cortex with the help of <b>AI</b> and <b>ML</b>, and takes those signals as control signals in order to control the eye. These signals are then sent to our frontal device which captures the image.</p>
<p>The image captured by the eye is then converted into data. While in our previous design we decided to send them directly to the optical lobe, but this could prove to be erroneous as it has a much higher risk for our users. We have now redesigned our conceptual visual aid to send this data through nerve endings which are close enough to take in that data stimulation without damaging the nerves themselves. This proved to be a challenge as now we need a professional for the mapping of the human nerve anatomy and until we do so, we may have come to a dead end.</p>
<p>This idea of a visual aid which first came as a desperate attempt from one of our team mates to come up with an idea for an assignment later became our team’s effort to make it as real as possible. When we decided to be a team, we were told to choose a topic as our project, our team simply decided to vote to go for the topic which had the highest marks in the assignment, but truth be told he was always eager to see where his idea went. Is it only fictional, one can daydream about on a summer afternoon, or was it something possible? I think the whole team realized what they had got themselves into when it dawned upon them that our concept can neither be produced or seen in any near future. We could have changed it into something simpler and along the lines of “getting good grades for the assignment”. But we decided to stick to it, because while the present is entertaining, the future is still more fascinating.</p>
<p>So, we decided to give our all, with all our unique perspectives. Although it was one project, we all had a different adventure. A different story coming from the same idea. Our team was productive, and even though we didn’t get to know each other on a personal level, we still got to share our view of the world and how each of us are working hard to make it better in our own way. In the end, I think we are all quite happy with what we have come up with. We may not be a team which has the best marks, but we are definitely a team who’s proud of their own work and would love to see it evolve and be a part of that evolution. We may not have been a team who communicated the most, but we may be a team who had the most synergy despite our situations. If there was an option to work together again, I believe each of us would gladly be on board. Working together for so long , I think that in itself is an achievement of ours.</p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Roles : </u></h3>
<p>To begin with, I think Tony (yiyang) plays a role as an HR in our group, considering he "recruited" us into the group and separated the tasks. And apart from that he also  plays
	a role in communication, as you know the members in this group are from different countries and have different habits, including the habit in terms of the application they use to
	chat or communicate in their daily life. Most of us prefer to use Messenger,but Tingyu Gong can only use Wechat. In order to solve this problem, Tony comes up an ideal. Since he
	had both Wechat and Messenger account, he is willing to bring the message to Gong or help him send the message to other members.  Then Steven is responsible for web-designing which
	may involve lots of coding, so I would say that he is a technical designer in our group. As for the Gong his task involves lots of data and he need to analyze those data and make some
	rank. Hence, his task immediately reminds me of a data analyst whose job is to take that data and use it to help companies make better business decisions. And for the Rainul, we choose
	to use his project idea and he is willing to cover this part in Assignment 2, as he knows the best about his own idea, which made him a lead developer in this group.  Finilally, Jimmy
	considers himself as an advisor, which is reasonable because not him only finds out what we need to prepare if we want to do some tests but also he lists some potential risks that this technology may cause. </p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Scopes and Limits : </u></h3>
<p>For this project we made concepts and ideas to develop an eye to enable blinds to see the world around them so we would show this product to anyone that’s willing to change their life and the lives of their loved ones in seeing this beautiful world. We will be using every technology invented to ensure this project to be successful through many difficulties that we may encounter. The device we plan to make is to enable the blind people who have amblyopia(lazy eye) or cataracts or other diseases to see again. We are trying to design our product in such a way that will also enable people who have no eyes to see again. However due to the limitation of the current technology and funding we are not able to build an actual prototype, what we can offer now is the solutions that can potentially solve this problem. We are trying to think ahead of our time so we may help our future generations to carry on with our work to make their life better. Given the state of the technology today, and the rate of improvement, we can estimate our product to be viable and for public use by the next 20-50 years. With enough man-power and research group, it could be done faster, but the risk would still remain. We must ensure our product is safe for usage for which we need time. Funding is also one of the bigger issues. We see scope to collaborate our research with those who are doing research on the same department as ours, there is also scope for us to start a fundraiser campaign to kick start our project. Though time itself will always come as a limitation but through our research we have found, even if our project sounds more fictional than real, in due time it is very much possible.
</p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Tools And Technologies : </u></h3>
<p>Our project is based on a concept and so it is important to mention that none of our teammates have any experience regarding the tools and technologies needed for our project. We have basic experience with programming and database structure but even in that regard our experience is very limited.</p>
<img src="image/AI1.jpg" align="right" style = "height:300px;width:500px;">
<p><b>Hardware: </b>When it comes to the hardware, we need certain tools to even start our project.</p>
	<ul>
			<li><b>Camera: </b>First we need a camera to test our idea, if the images captured can be converted to suitable data.</li>
			<li><b>tDCS: </b>We need tDCS to start our test of sending electrical waves through the brain of test subjects such as lab rats.</li>
			<li><b>Electrodes: </b>Is needed to send signals through the tDCS method.</li>
			<li><b>Server: </b>A server or data structure containing all our data from various test phases of ours.</li>
			<li><b>Chip: </b>Chips of various sizes serving different purpose such has having AI built in for conversion or reading of data.</li>
	</ul>
<p><b>Software:</b></p>
	<ul>
			<li><b>Artificial Intelligence: </b>Needed for conversion and manipulation of data, such as conversion of image into data. Also used to read <b>Spikes</b> of brain waves.</li>
			<li><b>Machine Learning: </b>Specially needed to read <b>field potential</b> of the brain and to convert them to control signals with the help of AI.</li>
			<li><b>Database: </b>Means of storing our data done through testing into the servers. </li>
	</ul>
<p><b>Lab Rats or Test animals: </b>Crucial to begin our testing phase. Their emotions and reactions will be recorded in our database.</p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Testing : </u></h3>
<ul>
	<li>R & D</li>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Wired connection :</b> connecting the artificial eye directly to the occipital lobe via conducting wires or a microchip implant.</li>
			<li><b>Wireless connection : </b>to connect neurons to an electrical impulse frequency reader which the eye becomes a portable video camera and passes the output in electrical impulses towards the reader.
					The reader sends the electrical impulses to the brain to analyse and give it meaning like a human eye.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Testing</li>
		<ul>
				<li>Testing of the prototype is conducted with animal analogs that are already blind or visually impaired of one or both eyes due to trauma or disease, or using lab-born animals which needs to be
					  approved by domestic and international ethics boards.</li>
				<li>The test consists of the process of incision of the prototype to the animal, the health and wellbeing of the animal is observed and recorded. The surgery is conducted by a neurosurgeon and
					  ophthalmologist with the assistance of nurses and veterinarians. The animal’s vision is tested by conducting a visual aid test ran by veterinarians.</li>
				<li>Testing of both wired and wireless is successful when the surgery is successful and there are no discernable problems and faults of the eye and vision post-surgery. The animal can complete the visual aid tests as well.</li>
				<li>The WHO defines human participants as any participant who undergoes social, biomedical, behavioural or epidemiological experiments and studies. They are exposed to observation of their behaviour and actions and are manipulated physically or mentally.
				<br><a href="​https://www.who.int/ethics/research/en/"> Heres a link on the Ethics Research</a></li>
				<li>Human testing is near-impossible and would be denied by any ethics & standards board domestically and internationally as the surgery is high risk and very dangerous to the participant. The surgery is also very difficult
					  and precise to perform, and require If the surgery is unsuccessful, the participant be affected with seriously injured to the brain or death.

		</ul>
</ul>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> TimeFrame : </u></h3>
<p>Regarding the task of our development project, the time left for us to prepare for development is actually very compact, and we have to take all our time and energy to face it. In this regard, we have developed a task allocation schedule, in which we have
	 prepared sufficient task objectives and the corresponding allocation time for each task, and we will also complete the corresponding content according to the timetable. The task is to ensure that the final project can be completed as expected.</p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Risk : </u></h3>
<p>The process of sight begins when light enters the eye,the cornea and lens focuses light to the retina. photoreceptors in the retina then convert the focused light into electrical inpulses, which is transported to the brain.</p>
<p>In blind people, part of the process doesn't work, the cornea or lens can be damaged from trauma or disease or the retina can't perceive light. In others, the signal is lost somewhere along the visual pathway in the brain.
<br><a href="https://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/bionic-eyes.htm">Here's a link to the Conditions about the Bionic Eye</a></p>
<p>When developing an eye that is wirelessly connected to a person's neurons, there are 4 main risks that can be concerning:</p>
<img src="image/risk.jpg" align="right" style = "height:300px;width:300px;">
	<ol>
			<li>Risk of developing new technology, there isn’t much reference of an artificial eye that possess the characteristics of an eye nor processes for the surgery.</li>
				<ul>
						<li>There are physical lens implants that can be used as a reference for our design, but only if the research information was given with consent by the manufacturer.</li>
						<li>There are no known studies that is similar to what we aim to develop, which means time, R&D and money increases.<br><br></li>
				</ul>
			<li>Developing a wired/wireless eye that connects to the brain/neurons can be halted due to international ethics from a scientific and medical standpoint.</li>
				<ul>
						<li>The construct of how to perform the surgery is life-threatening.</li>
						<li>Cannot be tested with human participants, unless experimental surgery is conducted with consent.</li>
						<li>It is also highly invasive.</li>
						<li>Finding human analogs for experimentation can be difficult from animal testing.</li>
						<li>It is near-impossible for the surgery to be done by man due to the complexity and extremely high risk.<br><br></li>
				</ul>
			<li>Technology and processes to work on neurons is not present today.</li>
				<ul>
						<li>The process of connecting specific neurons for eyesight or finding particular neurons does not exist yet.</li>
						<li>Medical machinery and technology have not reached the optimal precision to perform the surgery.<br><br></li>
				</ul>
			<li>Glass technology has not reached the same high-fidelity output as the human eye.</li>
				<ul>
						<li>The clarity and opacancy of the glass for cameras in the present are not the same quality as a human eye.</li>
						<li>The strength and mohs scale of the glass need to be very high, if there were to be any imperfections or scratches, it can cause visual artifacts for the user.</li>
						<li>Having sight that's slightly affected can deter people to consent to the life-threatening surgery.<br><br></li>
				</ul>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Group processes and communications :</u></h3>
<p>We Communicate through Wechat and Facebook messenger as everyone mostly is active on it and easier to communicate to each other, usually everyone replies back in a
	 few hours so not really a problem but even if it was we could always email them, we do meet once a week most of the times but sometimes twice a week if we get stuck on a part
	 that everyone needs to participate on apart from meeting during tutorial and lectures.</p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Skills And Jobs :</u></h3>
<p>The main purpose of our project is to rebuild  visual ability for the blind, to do so we want to build a device that can replace human eyes to collect visual data  and provide the same stimulation to the brain
   which can induce the brain to think that the data is provided through the eye, so it will create images for the visually impaired. Needless to say that this technology involves many technical fields related to brain  nerves, and none of our
	 team members have those skills. Therefore, we urgently need neurologists and use their professional skills to help us know better about how the visual system works, which nerves play which part, ect. So hiring a neurologist is our highest
	 priority in order to finish the job. As for the experience, we hope that our candidate have done additional training in optic nerve which is a paired cranial nerve that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.
   Besides the neurologist, we have decided that we also need to hire a 3D modeler who can  create three-dimensional models or visuals of our prototype using a variety of different computer software programs and tools, considering we may
	 experiencing tons of failures our prototype may frequently change from time to time so we hope our 3D modeler can take this job as his full time job. Additional we need to hire a Mechanical Engineer to design the prototype and finally a
	 programmer is the last position that we need to hire and his job is to write the code that translate the actually visual data to the information that our brain can process.</p>

<h2><u> Group Reflection </u></h2>
<p><b>Tony :</b><br>
	This is the second assignment that we have done as a group, and I have to emphasize that the efficiency is always the shiniest part of our group. Just like the last assignment we spread our task together  in the tutorial and seems most of us are satisfied with their job. And the communication between us were more frequent. And there is a very interesting thing happened during this work. Aaron finds that he has difficulty when he writes “plan and progress” part so he connects me and asks me if anyone is willing to change his part. Thanks to Rainul. He was so kind that he didn’t even think twice and agreed to change the tasks. Even I think we have achieved great progress we still have lots of aspects that need to work on. For example some of our team members are having difficulty in joining the discussion during the tutorial hopefully they can keep working on that part. But in general we have more discussion than before and thanks to the discussion I am able to see things from different aspects.

	What went well was that we were focused on our tasks when we didn’t have much time completing it due to our focus on other assignments for our other units. I was worried in the beginning that we were going to leave it out until the last week of the due date, but we all finished it within a week after our meeting. What also went well was the exchange of ideas about how to draft and tackle the project concept. We didn’t have the technology to produce what we have so we drafted it on paper. We exchanged many ideas of how to build and the problems it may come across when building and inserting it to a human. What can be improved is our time management, I’d say we could potentially finish it with our amount of time we were given initially but we left it till near the end. What was surprising was the amount of communication we had on the ideas of the project concept, it gave me a good grasp of what type of constraints and challenges that can occur. The one thing I’ve learned about the group is that they work really well when they are under pressure. They are able to focus on their tasks and communicate when they require assistance or updates on other members parts.

<p><b>Aaron :</b><br>
	For this Assignment, I think my team has formed a very good understanding, and the team members are very happy to help each other. We treat our own tasks with high efficiency. Everyone has completed their tasks within the prescribed time, and no one has deliberately supervised others. Everyone is conscious. Of course, every task is not easy, and there are certain problems that are particularly difficult for some members. Here, I would like to thank Rainul very much, because the task I got before, its professional theory and its conception are not friendly to me, I tried to turn to my team member, Rainul, a kind and responsible person, after learning the problems I faced, took the initiative to help me take on this challenge and gave me a relatively simple task, which made me realize the spirit of a good team. It is essential. Compared with the previous assignment, the communication time between our teams is more abundant. Everyone actively discusses and explores. Everyone will think differently from different angles. This is excellent. I hope that our future cooperation can continue to work harder.

	What well was that we all did the same thing as assignment 2 like taking different parts of the assignment to complete and what could be improved was the beginning of the assignment because we didn’t have much time to complete it but then it ended up going well as everyone completed their work which was surprising and unexpected to complete in a small period of time. A thing I learned in a group was the effort and teamwork we had to complete the work on time even though we had other work that needs to be done.
</p>

<p><b>Rainul :</b><br>
	My team performed very well given the time. We have gone more in depth to our project learning and discovering new things as we went through. We have also come up with new solutions to our previous problems but have also met with new challenges. Each of my teammates were very helpful and cooperative and we would resolve any problems that we come across together as a team. We have distributed our tasks equally so no one has more workload than the other ensuring our efficiency in each of our department that we are dealing with. We also do not feel confined to only our departments, we have turned to our teammates with advice and ideas so we could use each of our own unique abilities and using that to our team’s advantage. None of our team members felt any pressure of doing our work in a given timeframe, we have the trust and respect in each other’s abilities in performing our tasks in our own suitable time. We communicated better than before and we have a good synergy with each other. Personally, I am very happy with my team’s work and would love to work together in the future if possible.
